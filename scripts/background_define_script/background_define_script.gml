/*
Creates a new array that stores information for <obj_stage_manager> to use when drawing background (or foreground) layers.
If the optional argument "absolute" is set to true, the background is drawn from (0, 0) in the room.
Otherwise, the argument is drawn at the center of the camera.
Please note: Any backgrounds with a nonzero "xspd" or "yspd" should have "absolute" set to true and should have their sprite origin on the left so they wrap the screen properly.
The given script will be run by <obj_stage_manager> in place of the background being drawn normally.
The script is automatically passed the following arguments:
	- layer : Which "layer" (index in the background array) the background is on
	- draw_x : The x coordinate the background would be drawn at
	- draw_y : The y coordinate the background would be drawn at
	- cam_dist_x : The horizontal distance the camera has moved from the center
	- cam_dist_y : The vertical distance the camera has moved from the center
