/*
This function will move a grabbed player closer to the set grab_hold_* coordinates.
The speed at which the player moves is determined by the macro <grab_snap_speed>, unless the optional argument is used.
If no specific id is given, the player will use whatever id is stored in their grabbed_id variable.
If the grabbed player has grab_hold_enable equal to false, this function does nothing.
