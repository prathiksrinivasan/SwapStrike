Checks if any hitbox of the calling player has registered a hit yet.
You can use the optional arguments to check for attacks being blocked.
	- attack_connected(true) : Checks if the attack has hit or been blocked
	- attack_connected(true, true) : Checks if the attack has been blocked
	
Warning: This will NOT work when called from a projectile!
You should directly check the projectile's "has_hit" and "has_been_blocked" variables instead.
