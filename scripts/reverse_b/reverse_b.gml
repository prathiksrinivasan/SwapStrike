Changes the player's direction if they previously flicked the control stick opposite of the direction they are facing.
This is modeled after a common mechanic in platform fighters where flicking the control stick before using a special move will cause the player to turn around, hence the name "Reverse B".
For another special move turnaround function, see <b_reverse>.
