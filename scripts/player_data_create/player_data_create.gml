Creates a new player data array with the given properties, and adds it to the engine().<player_data> array.
Player data is the data stored for each player during matches, as opposed to CSS player data, which is the data stored on the character select screen.
Please note: Adding more player data after the start of a match will not add more players to the match; player data is only used in <players_spawn>.
