/*
Allows the player to drift left or right.
If "jump_is_dash_jump" is true, the player can drift up to the "max_air_speed_dash", otherwise speed is capped at the value of "max_air_speed".
If the player's speed is greater than the limit even before drift acceleration is applied, the speed will still be capped. See <aerial_drift_momentum> for the alternate version of this function.
Please note: This function can be called even if the player isn't currently in the air.
