To be called by <obj_game>.
This starts the process of saving a GIF file using the data stored in the "clip_array" variable.
The game meta state will be set to GAME_META_STATE.saving_clip while the GIF is being exported.
<Clip_Save_Frame> can be called to save each individual frame, and <clip_save_finish> to save the final GIF file with all of the frames added.
The number of frames saved is determined by <clip_length>.
The quality is determined by <clip_quality>.
