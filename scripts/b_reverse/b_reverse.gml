Changes the player's direction and horizontal speed if they are tilting the control stick opposite of the direction they are facing.
This is modeled after a common mechanic in platform fighters where flicking the control stick right after using a special move will cause the player to turn around, hence the name "B Reverse".
For another special move turnaround function, see <reverse_b>.
