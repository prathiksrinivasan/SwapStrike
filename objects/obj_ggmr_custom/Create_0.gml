This object is a simple networking object that can be used to send and receive packets through <obj_ggmr_net> connections.
It takes two callback functions - one for the step event and one for the async event.
It also automatically sends heartbeat packets to the other connections, and disconnects if no heartbeat is received back in a certain amount of time.
