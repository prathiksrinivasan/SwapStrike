///@category Hitboxes
/*
The parent object of all hitboxes, which are objects that can hit hurtboxes.
Similarly to hurtboxes, hitboxes are always owned by another instance - either an <obj_player> or an <obj_entity>.
obj_hitbox has two child objects - <obj_hitbox_attached> and <obj_hitbox_detached>.
This object and its direct children should never be created, as they are only used to categorize different hitbox types and can't actually hit anything.
