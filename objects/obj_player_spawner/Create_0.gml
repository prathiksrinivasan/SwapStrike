/*
This object marks a spot where players will be spawned at the start of a match.
The order the spawners are chosen in is determined by the Instance Creation Order in the room.
Please note: Players will snap out of blocks upwards when spawned, so it is okay if spawners are partially inside slopes or if the origin for a player's sprite would cause them to spawn inside a block.
