/*
Entities are special objects that can be spawned by players.
They can create their own hitboxes and hurtboxes, use palette shaders, and can run custom update code from User Event 0.
The player that owns the entity is stored in the instance variable "player_id".
Custom variables must be properties of the "custom_entity_struct", and custom variables that store instance ids must be properties of the "custom_ids_struct".
