///@category Hurtboxes
/*
Hurtboxes are objects that can be hit by hitboxes and run specific code during these interactions.
Similarly to hitboxes, hurtboxes are always owned by another instance - either an <obj_player> or an <obj_entity>.
There are 3 types of hurtboxes:
	- Permanent : Always stays with the owner instances, has an infinite lifetime.
	- Attack : Only exists during an attack, has a set lifetime and will also be destroyed instantly if the owner stops attacking.
	- Shield : Used for the "perfect_shield_start" / "parry_shield" shield types when shield poking is enabled.
