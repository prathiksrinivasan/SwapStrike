/*
This is the parent object for all animation objects in stages, which are objects that do NOT affect gameplay.
The User Event 0 of all animation objects is automatically called by <game_advance_frame>.
The User Event 1 is called when the object is drawn, though you can also override the Draw event if you wish.
