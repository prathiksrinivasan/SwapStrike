/*
A solid slope block.
The angle of the slope is stored in the "slope_angle" variable, while the normal angle is in "slope_normal".
The type of slope is stored in the "slope_type" variable, which is from the SLOPE_TYPE enum, and determines how players bounce off the slope in <check_tech>:
	- perpendicular_bounce: Players always bounce away at the "slope_normal" angle (perpendicular to the slope).
	- calculated_bounce: Players bounce based on the angle of impact.
Warning: The default slope type is "perpendicular_bounce" because "calculated_bounce" can cause issues if the angle of impact is too close to the slope's angle.
