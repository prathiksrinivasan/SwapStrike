///@category Hitboxes
/*
A detectbox is a type of attached hitbox that activates custom code when first colliding with a hurtbox.
By default, detectboxes will run the PHASE.detection of the player's current attack, however, a "detect_script" can be assigned to the detectbox to be run instead.
The following arguments are passed to the attack script / detect script:
	- The id of the detected hurtbox's owner
	- The id of the detectbox
You can set the "detect_multihit" variable to allow a detectbox to hit players multiple times without having to manually reset hitbox groups every frame.
